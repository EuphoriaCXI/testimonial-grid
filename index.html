                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
                more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I
                signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
                Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
                encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
                very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,
                in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as
                an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
